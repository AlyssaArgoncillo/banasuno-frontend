            Cities trap heat. Concrete, asphalt, dense buildings, and limited green spaces cause urban areas to be significantly hotter than surrounding rural locations - a phenomenon known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. As cities grow, this heat buildup becomes more intense and more frequent.
